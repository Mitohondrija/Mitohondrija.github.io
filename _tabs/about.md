Hi, I’m **Dimitrije Pavlov** — a **Junior Software Engineer** with a strong interest in **cybersecurity** and **penetration testing**.  
I’m passionate about understanding how systems work under the hood and learning how to make them more secure.

This blog is my personal space to **document my journey** into ethical hacking and cybersecurity, as I continue to grow as a professional and prepare for the **OSCP certification**.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to follow along as I share my progress, experiences, and lessons learned along the way.
